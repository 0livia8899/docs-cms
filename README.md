## About The Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project used to fetch documents using the [Lark Server APIs](https://open.larksuite.com/document/server-docs/getting-started/server-api-list) and to display them online as documentation.

## Getting Started

```

### Set environment variables

Run the following command to copy the default example and replace with your own variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Run the development server
